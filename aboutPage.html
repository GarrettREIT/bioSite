                        George Winfield or known by his western friends and family Denver George, was born in Huston, 
                        Texas on October 2nd 1951 making him 70 years strong. Being in his prime by the start of the 70s 
                        George embraced the hippy lifestyle. He dropped out of school at the age of 16 and hit the road 
                        looking for work and a life. He started working as an apartment painter in Houston Texas but soon 
                        found that he lacked professionalism. His boss noticed too. So much that he recommended George to 
                        apply to Union Pacific Railroad because of the stability, structure and pay. But mostly to get rid 
                        of him. So George applied and when he saw his boss again he told him he got the job. Confused because 
                        his boss never heard from Union Pacific regarding the referral. George explained that he got a job 
                        with Southern Pacific. George stayed with them for the remainder of their time as a company.

                        Working initially as a painter, getting laid off and put back to work multiple times he then took a job as a 
                        dispatcher. This was a hard job to get and usually required a college degree let alone a high school 
                        dropout. But George was great at this job. He could remember all sorts of computer commands and routing 
                        paths. George loves to travel, having been to 5 different countries, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, and 
                        Puerto Rico. Out of all the places hes been Montezuma and Monteverde in Costa Rica were the coolest 
                        and most beautiful places hes claimed to have been. He loves sports, mostly Texas including the Long 
                        Horns, Astros, and Rockets.
