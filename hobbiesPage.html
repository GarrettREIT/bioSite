                           George is an interesting individual. Even though hes friend and family oriented I still use 
                           the term individual because from day one he set out on his own. Making new friends, connections, 
                           and memories. As I sit here writing this, I listen to a few of his favorite songs such as Bad Trick 
                           by Ray Wylie Hubbard, Broken Poets Dream by Hayes Carll and Hubbard, I see his past experiences, 
                           connections and memories put into words and a melody. When you go over to Georgies house in Carter Lake, IA 
                           you get a taste of music, history, and some damn good conversation.

                           When introducing myself to new people 
                           you get a taste of music, history, and some damn good conversation. When introducing myself to new people 
                           sometimes I throw in a random tidbit of me having an uncommon knowledge of random railroad facts because 
                           George would have a new, or even the same story to tell you about it every time you came over. The railroad 
                           was his life. He was told to apply to the railroad by his at the time boss working painting apartments. He went 
                           to apply and applied for the wrong railroad company. Next thing you know hes working his way up, working different 
                           jobs and a stable living. Southern Pacific Railroad was established in 1856 and shut its doors in 1996. One of his 
                           most memorable experiences was at the Second Atlantic Pop Festival in 1970 where he heard Jimmy Hendrix play the 
                           Star-Spangled Banner live. Most beautiful place George said he traveled to was Monteverde, Costa Rica. Monteverde 
                           is 4,662 ft above sea level and located in the Northwestern quadrant of the country. Home to 2,500 species of plants, 
                           400 varieties of birds, and over 100 types of mammals.
